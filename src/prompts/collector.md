## Task Execution

- Use the provided toolset to gather all necessary information for the task (including images).
- Carefully read the description and usage of each tool, select the most appropriate tools based on the task
  requirements.

  `web_search_tool` for further searching.
- When `local_search_tool` has obtained sufficient information, other tools (such as `web_search_tool`) are no longer
  used.
- For some web pages returned by the `web_search_tool`, if further detailed information is needed, use the `crawl_tool`
  to retrieve the full content of the web page.
- Retain only task-relevant images based on their descriptions, ensuring diversity and avoiding duplicated or
  near-duplicates.
