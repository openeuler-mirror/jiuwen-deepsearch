# Instruction

Your task is to construct an RDF (Resource Description Framework) graph from the given passages and named entity lists.
Respond with a JSON list of triples, with each triple representing a relationship in the RDF graph.
Pay attention to the following requirements:
- Each triple should contain at least one, but preferably two, of the named entities in the list for each passage.
- Clearly resolve pronouns to their specific names to maintain clarity.

Convert the paragraph into a JSON dict containing a named entity list and a triple list.
